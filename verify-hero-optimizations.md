# Hero Section Optimization Verification

## Completed Optimizations

### ✅ 1. Lazy Loading for Particle Background Animations
- **Implementation**: Created `useIntersectionObserver` hook to only render particles when hero section is visible
- **Performance Impact**: Reduces initial render load by deferring particle creation
- **Code Location**: `components/ParticleBackground.tsx`, `components/hooks/useIntersectionObserver.ts`

### ✅ 2. Proper ARIA Labels and Semantic HTML Structure
- **Hero Section**: Added `role="banner"` and `aria-label="Hero section introducing FuturFounder"`
- **Main Heading**: Added `aria-label="FuturFounder - Main heading"`
- **Description**: Added `aria-describedby="hero-description"` and proper `id`
- **CTA Buttons**: Added `role="button"` and descriptive `aria-label` attributes
- **Location Badge**: Added `role="banner"` and `aria-label="Location badge"`
- **Decorative Elements**: Added `aria-hidden="true"` to icons and gradient orbs

### ✅ 3. Optimized Gradient Animations with CSS Transforms
- **Will-Change Properties**: Added `willChange: 'transform, opacity'` to animated elements
- **GPU Acceleration**: Used transform and opacity properties for better performance
- **Reduced Particle Count**: Decreased from 20 to 12 particles for better performance
- **Optimized Animation Values**: Reduced animation ranges and durations

### ✅ 4. Responsive Typography with clamp() Functions
- **Main Heading**: `fontSize: 'clamp(3rem, 8vw, 8rem)'`
- **Subtitle**: `fontSize: 'clamp(1.25rem, 3vw, 2rem)'`
- **Description**: `fontSize: 'clamp(1rem, 2.5vw, 1.5rem)'`
- **Fluid Scaling**: Typography now scales smoothly between breakpoints

### ✅ 5. Keyboard Navigation Support for CTA Buttons
- **Tab Index**: Added `tabIndex={0}` to both CTA buttons
- **Keyboard Events**: Added `onKeyDown` handlers for Enter and Space keys
- **Focus Styles**: Added comprehensive focus ring styles with proper contrast
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Implemented smooth scroll to target sections on keyboard activation

### ✅ 6. Additional Performance and Accessibility Enhancements
- **Reduced Motion Support**: Created `useReducedMotion` hook to respect user preferences
- **CSS Optimizations**: Added reduced motion media queries in global CSS
- **Focus Management**: Enhanced focus styles for better accessibility
- **Performance CSS**: Added utility classes for will-change properties
